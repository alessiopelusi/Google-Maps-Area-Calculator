# Google MapsAreas Calculator
This Javascript script leverages Google maps APIs to create an interactive map enabling the user to calculate the area of a building.

Practical Application: Providing potential customers with a quote for the installation of photovoltaic systems based on the area of their structure.

 ● Here is how the project works in step-by-step points:

1 ● Address Input: The user enters the address of the building for which they want to calculate the area. This step activates the JavaScript function that displays the selected building on Google Maps.

2 ● Building Visualization: The JavaScript function displays the desired building on the web page using Google Maps, allowing the user to clearly see the area of interest directly on the map.

3 ● Defining the Area: With simple clicks on the map, the user can define the exact area they want to calculate. This process is intuitive and enables the user to accurately delineate the desired area.

4 ● Area Calculation: After the user has defined the desired area on the map, they can calculate it by clicking a button. 

To works, the code requires a private Google Maps API key, which should be inserted into the code, replacing "<YOUR-GOOGLE-API-KEY>".
